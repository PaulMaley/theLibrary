## The library at the end of the universe 
A project

The iota-point: The point at which the number of quantum states used to
archive the (searchable) record of the past is equal to the number of
states available for the future evolution of the universe.
A relativistically invariant definition (avoiding problems of simultaneity)
is work in progress.
